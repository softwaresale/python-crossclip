# Contributing to Crossclip
All contributions are welcome! 

## Steps to contribute
1. Find something to work on:
If you want to tackle a bug, visit the Issues tab [here](https://github.com/softwaresale/crossclip/issues).
If you want to suggest a feature, submit an issue.
2. Fork, clone, and branch:
Before you do anything, fork this repository. Clone your copy of the repository, and then check out a new
branch. If you're fixing a big, call it something like `issue-#` or `fix-#` where # represents the issue
number. If you are developing a new feature, call it something like `dev-feature` where feature is the name
of whatever feature you're working on. Make sure to checkout this branch.
3. Code away:
Make sure to follow the best python practices. Write well documented code. This project uses restructured text
docstring format. Look around for examples.
4. Commit:
Commit your code. Commit messages should have a format like such:
`module: Brief description \n\n Longer description`. Module should be whatever module you're working on. If it
is a project file, use `proj`. Provide a brief description of what your commit does, and then a longer description
if necessary (e.g how you fixed it, potential issues, general thoughts, etc.)
5. Pull Request:
Push your commits and submit a pull request. It may or may not be merged on the first try. If it doesn't, keep working
at it so that it can be merged.
6. Bask in your achievement:
You just contributed something useful to this project! Pat yourself on the back. :)
